# Seat Finder
I have created a Flutter app that shows the birth map of mostly Indian trains.
It shows the type of birth with its position in the Bogie.
A search bar can be seen at the top after the App bar, which allows user to input their seat number; after that, the page will get  scrolled to show the location of that seat.
